# Machine Learning Initiatives

This repository documents Machine Learning projects and associated analytical workflows.

## Repository Structure

The content is organized into the following directory:

-   `02_Data_Visualization/`: Contains resources dedicated to data visualization methodologies relevant to Machine Learning applications.
    -   `01_Scatter_plot.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook illustrating the application of scatter plots for data exploration and relationship analysis within datasets intended for Machine Learning.

## Content Overview

### `02_Data_Visualization/01_Scatter_plot.ipynb`

This Jupyter Notebook provides a practical demonstration of scatter plot utilization in data analysis. Key areas covered include:

-   Fundamentals of scatter plots and their analytical significance in Machine Learning.
-   Implementation using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
-   Visualization of bivariate and multivariate relationships.
-   Customization techniques for enhanced data representation through visual attributes (color, markers, size).
-   Interpretation of visual patterns to identify potential correlations and insights.
